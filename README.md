# Ping Pong Table Project Portfolio

## Project Description
The Arcade Ping Pong Table Project is a mechatronic rendition of the classic interactive two-player arcade game. The players control a linear actuator to try to score points by hitting the ball past the opponent's backline. 

My role as the Project Developer at Zen Maker Lab was to lead the design and production of the project utilizing laser cutting and FDM 3d printing for component production, along with wire soldering, breadboard wiring, and C programming for putting it together. Using AutoCAD, Fusion360, and SolidWork for designs, and Arduino UNO as the microcontroller and L298N motor driver on dedicated programs to power the DC and stepper motors. 

The project is developed into two versions for marketing and curriculum purposes.

## Curriculum Project Kit Version
The project kit version of the Ping Pong Table is designed to be the curriculum of the mechatronic Course at Zen Maker Lab, where I take on the second role as an instructor. throughout the course, I instructed students in engineering thinking and design principles, along with technical skills such as soldering, 3D design, and circuit building during the course. The students demonstrated competence in learning and adapting technical and important skills to their version of the project.

## Marketing Version
The marketing version of the Ping Pong Table is built to be the showpiece at Zen Maker Lab for marketing use and be an interactive attraction for customers to introduce mechatronics and robotics to prospective engineers.
