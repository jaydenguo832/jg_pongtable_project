# Ping Pong Table Project Portfolio

## Project Description
The Arcade Ping Pong Table Project is a mechatronic rendition of the classic interactive two-player arcade game. The players control a linear actuator to try to score points by hitting the ball past the opponent's backline. 

My role as the Project Developer at Zen Maker Lab was to lead the design and production of the project utilizing laser cutting and FDM 3D printing for component production, along with wire soldering, breadboard wiring, and C programming for putting it together. Using AutoCAD, and Fusion360 for designs, and Arduino UNO as the microcontroller and L298N motor driver on dedicated programs to power the DC motors. 

As an instructor, I taught engineering thinking and design principles, along with technical skills such as soldering, 3D design, and circuit building during the course. The students demonstrated competence in learning and adapting technical and important skills to their own spin on the project.

## Key Designs
### Linear Actuator
The mechanism utilizes a comma-shaped coupler rotating on a DC motor to do the paddle actuation and a rubber band to provide the launching force of the paddle to hit the ball. It is a simple design for ease of repair and reproduction.
